## [2026-01-24 12:00] Task: Tracer Bullet 1 - End-to-end for ONE player
- What was done: Set up project structure with package.json, tsconfig.json, .env.example, .gitignore. Created src/ folder with config.ts (player IDs), opendota.ts (API client to fetch recent matches), stats.ts (W/L calculation logic), and index.ts (entry point).
