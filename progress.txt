# Progress Log

## [2026-01-24 12:00] Task: Tracer Bullet 1 - End-to-end for ONE player
- What was done: Set up project structure with package.json, tsconfig.json, .env.example, .gitignore. Created src/ folder with config.ts (player IDs), opendota.ts (API client to fetch recent matches), stats.ts (W/L calculation logic), and index.ts (entry point). Successfully fetches matches from OpenDota API and calculates daily W/L stats for one player, printing results to console.
- Files changed: package.json, tsconfig.json, .env.example, .gitignore, src/config.ts, src/opendota.ts, src/stats.ts, src/index.ts

## [2026-01-24 12:30] Task: Tracer Bullet 2 - Telegram integration
- What was done: Created src/bot.ts with grammy bot setup (createBot and sendMessage functions). Updated src/index.ts to format stats message with HTML and send it to Telegram chat using configured bot token and chat ID. Message includes formatted date, player stats, and total matches count.
- Files changed: src/bot.ts (new), src/index.ts

## [2026-01-24 13:00] Task: Add all 7 players with config module
- What was done: Updated index.ts to fetch stats for all 7 players instead of just one test player. Added fetchAllPlayersStats() function that fetches matches for all players in parallel using Promise.all. Updated formatStatsMessage() to display stats for all players and calculate total matches across all players. Removed unused TEST_PLAYER_ID from config.ts.
- Files changed: src/index.ts, src/config.ts

## [2026-01-24 15:59] Task: Format beautiful message with all players stats
- What was done: Created dedicated formatter.ts module with enhanced message formatting. Added performance-based emojis (🔥 for 75%+, ✅ for 50%+, 😐 for 25%+, 💀 for below, 😴 for inactive). Players are sorted by activity (most matches first, then by win rate). Added team summary section with total matches, wins/losses, team win rate, and active players count. Refactored index.ts to use the new formatter module.
- Files changed: src/formatter.ts (new), src/index.ts, PRD.md

## [2026-01-24 16:30] Task: Add cron job for daily stats at 23:55 MSK
- What was done: Refactored index.ts to use node-cron for scheduling daily stats. Added sendDailyStats() function that handles the stats fetching and sending logic. Scheduled cron job to run at 23:55 MSK (20:55 UTC) using cron expression "55 20 * * *". Added RUN_NOW environment variable support for testing immediate execution. Bot now runs continuously waiting for scheduled tasks.
- Files changed: src/index.ts, PRD.md

## [2026-01-24 16:05] Task: Add Dockerfile and railway.json for deployment
- What was done: Created multi-stage Dockerfile with builder stage (installs all deps, compiles TypeScript) and production stage (only production deps, runs compiled JS). Created railway.json with Dockerfile builder configuration and restart policy (ON_FAILURE with max 10 retries). Both files are optimized for Railway free tier deployment.
- Files changed: Dockerfile (new), railway.json (new), PRD.md
