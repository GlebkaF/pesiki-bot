# Ralph Methodology

This project uses the Ralph methodology for AI-assisted development.

## Core Principle

Ralph = Repeated AI Loop Producing High-quality code

The AI picks tasks from a PRD, implements ONE task per iteration, commits, and updates progress.

## Key Files

- `PRD.md` - Product Requirements Document with all tasks as checkboxes
- `progress.txt` - Append-only log of completed work

## Rules for Ralph Iterations

1. **One task at a time** - Never work on multiple tasks in one iteration
2. **Always commit** - Each iteration ends with a git commit
3. **Update progress** - Append to progress.txt after each task
4. **Check the box** - Mark completed tasks as [x] in PRD.md
5. **Small scope** - If a task is too big, break it down first

## Cursor Commands

- `/ralph` - Execute one Ralph iteration (implement next task)
- `/ralph-plan` - Create or refine the PRD
- `/ralph-status` - Check current progress
